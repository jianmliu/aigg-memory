## 1. Thesis

Pluchino's Talent-vs-Luck shows success tracks **luck more than talent**, because talent is
*passive* (a fixed multiplier) while luck *compounds* (early breaks snowball through a
rich-get-richer dynamic). The Effort-Luck-Choice (ELC) refinement isolates the exact slot
where this can be reversed: **choice** — whether you seize the good draw and skip the trap,
gated by **discernment** `q = clamp(talent + faculty)`.

**Claim:** discernment is not a constant. With memory it is *learned* (you remember the trap
that burned you), *socially shared* (a friend warns you), and *auditable* (your track record
makes your skill legible to those allocating capital). aigg-memory is the substrate for all
three. So the research question sharpens from "does talent matter?" to **"does a memory that
makes choice better let talent reclaim success from luck — and through which channels?"**

## 2. The three composed models (grounded)

- **ELC** (`effort-luck-choice.ts`): three channels on a pure STF (`applyTx`) with
  per-agent **independent** seeded PRNGs *outside* the STF (counterfactual-clean — the luck
  hand dealt to an agent is identical across conditions, so a treatment's causal effect is
  readable):
  - **effort** — a flat, faculty-independent grind (`effortEarn` per turn).
  - **luck** — exogenous multiplicative events *dealt* to you (good ×`goodF` / trap ×`badF`).
  - **choice** — good draws are seized; a trap hits unless avoided (`avoidRoll < q`), with
    discernment `q = clamp01(talent + faculty)`. `faculty=0` reproduces TvL (luck dominates).
    Metrics: `ρ(wealth,talent)`, `ρ(wealth,skill)`, `ρ(wealth,luck)`, `Gini`. A **patron**
    allocates a budget by policy (`meritocratic` = reward current winners = reward luck;
    `egalitarian`; `talent` = oracle upper bound; `random`).
- **Generative-Agents emergences** (in `examples/eval/`, all reproduced + ablated):
  information **diffusion**, relationship **formation**, **coordination** — measured directly
  from the git-versioned store.
- **aigg-memory**: observe → reflect (facts→beliefs) → plan (+ stale-replan) → recall; with
  reconcile (correction/temporal, **no-guess → `needs_review`**), provenance
  (`asserted_by`/`source_events`), valid-time, and a git-versioned, auditable history.

## 3. The unified model — a four-channel decomposition of success

ELC decomposes wealth into effort + luck + choice. We split **choice** into an *individual*
and a *social* term, yielding four channels:

```
wealth ~ effort            # the slope: flat grind (given)
       + luck              # the deal: exogenous, dealt independently (given)
       + faculty_individual# learned discernment: q rises as memory accrues  (aigg-memory)
       + social_capital    # shared discernment + reach: network centrality  (the emergences)
```

The decisive change to ELC: `faculty` is no longer a static per-agent constant. It becomes

```
q_t(agent, opp_type) = clamp( talent
                            + facultyFromMemory(agent, opp_type, t)   # H-mem
                            + socialWarning(agent, opp_type, t) )      # H-social
```

`facultyFromMemory` rises when the agent has reflected "opp_type X is a trap" from past
episodes; `socialWarning` is non-zero when a relationship-neighbour holds such a belief and it
has diffused to the agent. **Effort and luck are fate; the two choice terms are built — and
memory is what builds them.**

## 4. How the three emergences map to economic channels

The emergences are not decoration; each feeds a specific channel, and together they form the
`social_capital` axis — the only success channel besides effort that is *constructible*.

| Emergence | Channel it feeds | Economic mechanism | aigg-memory primitive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Information **diffusion** | **choice** (social discernment) | hear "type X is a trap" / "good opp" from others → effective `q` rises **without paying the cost** | observe / recall + provenance |
| Relationship **formation** | **conduit + capital + legibility** | the network diffusion travels on; compounding affinity (returning-visitor continuity); the *reputation* that makes skill visible to a patron | `person_<id>` units, reflect, the auditable store |
| **Coordination** | **choice multiplier** (collective seize) | assemble a group to seize an opportunity a lone agent can't (a class of high-`bigF` events that fire only for an attending coalition); reliability gates it | goal→plan→invite→attend + stale-replan |

The three form a **value chain**, each stage memory-powered: build the network (relationships)
→ the network carries warnings/tips (diffusion) → the network + trust enables joint seizing
(coordination). Social ability is itself a compounding pipeline.

## 5. aigg-memory's role — the bridge

The ELC substrate is untouched; aigg-memory enters at exactly one line — the discernment `q` —
and (optionally) the patron's information set:

- **Decision time:** the agent `observe`s the current opportunity's type; `recall` returns
  whether it (or a co-located, relationship-connected neighbour) holds a "type=trap" belief →
  the `facultyFromMemory` + `socialWarning` terms of `q_t`.
- **Sleep:** `reflect` consolidates repeated trap-encounters into a "type X is a trap" belief
  (private learning); `plan` provides metabolic foresight (don't act into the poverty trap).
- **Patron:** an optional `track-record` policy reads each agent's **auditable** avoidance
  history (provenance-stamped, versioned) to allocate by demonstrated skill — see H-legibility.

The interface contract is one function and one optional policy:

```
facultyFromMemory(agentCorpus, oppType, t) -> number   # via /memory/select over aigg-memory
trackRecord(agentCorpus) -> skillEstimate              # via the versioned store / timeline
```

## 6. Hypotheses

- **H-mem (learned discernment).** Replace static `faculty` with `q_t = clamp(talent +
  f(memory_t))`. Prediction: discernment **rises over turns** (a learning curve); `ρ(wealth,
  skill)` grows *more* the longer the run, where static-faculty is flat. Ablation: reflect
  on/off → with memory, late-game trap-avoidance ≫ early; without, flat. *Static faculty
  cannot show a learning curve — the curve is aigg-memory's signature.*
- **H-social (shared discernment).** Add `socialWarning` from diffused trap-beliefs.
  Prediction: high relationship-centrality agents eat fewer traps; `social_capital` gains
  independent explanatory power for wealth beyond talent and luck. **(E2: ρ(wealth,centrality)
  = +0.995 with the warning network, +0.28 without — social capital is real but purely
  instrumental.)** *Refinement — `social_capital` has a **sign**:* the same network channel
  carries warnings (E2, positive-sum, welfare↑) **or** a pump cabal's "buy + recruit" (E6,
  negative-sum, welfare↓). The identical `ρ(wealth, centrality/earliness)` appears in both, so
  social capital "paying" is welfare-ambiguous — *earned* (you help others) vs *extracted* (you
  recruit marks) is legible only from the recipients' sign, not the correlation.
- **H-immunity (memory is herd-level, not only individual).** A pump needs marks (memoryless
  followers); a memory-equipped agent (E5) refuses and won't relay, so the pump percolates only
  through the susceptible sub-network. Prediction: above a memory-penetration threshold (≈ the
  site-percolation threshold `1 − 1/⟨k⟩` of the peer graph) the cascade shatters and the pump
  dies. **(E6: a society's manipulator-profit collapses from 535 marks to ~0 as memory crosses
  ~80% on a ⟨k⟩=6 network — a society that remembers can't be pumped, because there are no
  marks.)** Pyramid/MLM recruitment (single-path) is far more fragile — a memory minority
  suffices.
- **H-coord (collective seize) — unified with the pump.** Coordination unlocks coalition-only
  returns a lone agent can't reach. But the machinery (plan→invite→assemble) is *identical* to a
  pump cabal's; the only difference is the **value source**: an external beneficiary paid for
  value the coalition produced (a venture, counterparty welfare +) vs a transfer from recruited
  marks (a pump, counterparty welfare −). **(E3: ρ(wealth, coordination) = +1.0 for both, so
  wealth cannot tell them apart; the discriminator is the counterparty-welfare sign.)** Memory
  is what reads it: with `track_record`, members refuse leaders whose history harmed
  counterparties → pumps starve, total welfare flips from −1 to +273, and coordination pays
  *only if it creates value* (ρ → +0.64). So "coalition-only opportunity" is not a separate
  thing from the pump — it is the *same* act with the value-source knob turned to production, and
  only memory makes the two legible.
- **H-legibility (memory makes skill bankable) — confirmed.** A `track-record` patron policy
  (allocate by audited avoidance history) **beats `meritocratic`** (allocate by current wealth =
  reward luck), approaching the `talent` upper bound. *`meritocratic` fails because no one can
  tell "won" from "got lucky"; aigg-memory supplies the record that can.* **(E4: realized-talent
  `track_record` +0.703 ≈ `talent` oracle +0.710 ≫ `meritocratic` +0.493, which also runs the
  highest Gini.)**
- **H-equity (the open question).** Does the social layer **democratize** luck (warnings
  protect the low-talent → `Gini` ↓) or **concentrate** it (the well-connected hear and seize
  first → Matthew effect → `Gini` ↑)? And does the `track-record` patron correct it?

## 7. The market / reflexivity extension

Markets are the natural limit of this model, with one structural change and one bright line.

- **Endogenous (reflexive) price.** Unlike ELC's *exogenous* luck, a market price is the
  aggregate of everyone's choices. "Social ability to rally buying" no longer just *finds* an
  opportunity — it *manufactures* one by moving the price (Soros reflexivity): a call → price
  up → the call looks validated → more buyers → cascade → pop.
- **The prosocial→antisocial duality.** The *same* social ability that is prosocial in
  Smallville (warn a friend off a trap) becomes antisocial in a money market (lure a friend
  into a trap you set, then sell into the rally). Structurally that is a **pump-and-dump**.
  This duality is itself a finding: in a reflexive market, how much of social capital's return
  is **information** (legitimate edge) vs **manipulation**?
- **Two legitimate, sharper instruments (simulation only):**
  1. **Prediction market as a discernment scorer.** A play-money market with a proper scoring
     rule (Brier / log) is the cleanest possible measurement of `q`. Does memory improve
     forecast *calibration* over rounds (H-mem in its purest form)? Does diffusing a true
     signal yield wisdom-of-crowds or herding (correlated error)?
  2. **Memory as anti-manipulation immunity (the headline aigg-memory result).** In a
     simulated market with a manipulator (pump agent) among a population, do memory-equipped
     agents get rugged *less*? This exercises every aigg-memory signature: **provenance**
     (what is the caller's track record?), **no-guess/`needs_review`** (a "guaranteed 10×"
     claim inconsistent with history → distrust, don't follow), **reflection** ("this rhetoric
     = pump → trap belief"), **reconcile** (the called price vs the realized price). Prediction:
     memory immunizes against manipulation — the ethical inverse of a pump tool. **Herd-level
     (E6/H-immunity):** because the same relationship network is a *neutral* channel — warnings
     in E2, a pump cabal's "buy + recruit" here — the pump is a percolation on the *memoryless*
     sub-network; past a memory-penetration threshold (≈ `1 − 1/⟨k⟩`) it cannot recruit enough
     marks and dies. Memory's immunity is collective, not just personal. We model the cabal only
     to measure that immunity (the build target is the immune system, not the pathogen).

- **Reflexive is a trichotomy, not "always a pump."** A coordinated price move can be **create**
  (production, value made), **discover** (information aggregated → price → fundamental), or
  **extract** (a pump, no information → price away from fundamental). Discovery and extraction are
  *mechanically identical in the moment* — coordinated trading moving a price; the only
  discriminator is **ex-post persistence**: a discovery's move PERSISTS (the price was right), a
  pump's REVERTS (the rug, the price was wrong). You can only tell over time. So memory is not
  only defensive — it is **constitutive of price discovery**: only by remembering which past
  signals held up (valid-time, `reconcile` of called-vs-realized, `track_record`) can a market
  reward real signals and starve fake ones. A market without memory can't discover prices either;
  it can't tell a prophet from a pumper.

- **The asset: a fund share (price vs NAV), and the Ponzi as the controllable failure mode.**
  The natural price target is not the currency (GCC — you can't pump the numéraire) but a **fund
  share** whose fundamental is its **NAV** = Σ the holdings' memory-computed value (track records).
  The market price's premium/discount to NAV *is* the reflexive gap (Hype Cycle, pump). The
  failure mode is the **Ponzi**: returns paid from new deposits, not NAV — its defining number is
  the **coverage ratio = NAV / liabilities**, < 1 from launch and hidden by fresh money. The
  *control* is purely informational: memory computes NAV, audits the **provenance of past payouts**
  (from NAV growth vs from new deposits — `reconcile` of claimed-vs-realized), and reads the
  manager's track record; a Ponzi survives only on fresh belief, so visibility kills it via the
  redemption run + herd immunity. **(E8: a Ponzi's reach falls ~ (1 − memory) — haul 200→40,
  victims 1000→200 — it reaches only the unaudited minority; coverage insolvent throughout.)** A
  Ponzi needs darkness; memory is light.
- **The Hype Cycle is reflexive belief's waveform; memory is its damper.** Create/discover/extract
  are not three events but three *phases* of one curve: an inflated expectation **diffuses** →
  overshoots fundamental (Peak of Inflated Expectations = the pump phase), **reconcile** against
  reality reverts it (Trough of Disillusionment), **reflect** finds the true value (Slope of
  Enlightenment → Plateau). **(E7: a clean Hype Cycle — peak 1.99 → trough 0.40 → plateau 1.00 at
  F=1.)** Memory acts at two levels: *within* a cycle, `reconcile` drives peak→plateau; *across*
  cycles, `reflect` yields a meta-belief about the shape ("hype peaks revert") so an agent doesn't
  buy the top. Hence **hype amplitude ≈ (1 − memory)** (E7: 0.99 → 0.50 → 0.0 as the crowd
  remembers) — a society that all remembers has no bubble, the efficient-market limit. Memory's
  third role beyond blocking pumps (E6) and enabling discovery: **damping the hype cycle itself.**

## 8. Canonical scenario — the fund share (price vs NAV)

One asset threads every channel, hypothesis, and instrument above and keeps the kernel central:
**a fund share, traded at a price, whose fundamental is its NAV.** The fund holds a basket of
agents; its **NAV = Σ the holdings' memory-computed value** (their `track_record`s — demonstrated
competence). The share **price** is belief-driven; the **premium/discount to NAV** *is* the
reflexive gap. (Not the currency: you can't pump GCC, the numéraire — you pump shares *priced in*
it.) It is still, in spirit, pricing cognition — a basket of demonstrated competence — and only
memory knows the true competence, so **memory is the NAV oracle.**

**Mechanics.** A signal — "this fund is the next big thing, buy the shares" — diffuses (the
network rails). A believer buys → the share price rises above NAV → the premium *looks like* the
fund winning → more believe → the premium cascades. **Buying doesn't reveal value; it inflates the
price** (Soros reflexivity, self-fulfilling). The **manipulator** variant is the **Ponzi fund**
(§7): it pays "returns" from new deposits, not NAV — coverage = NAV/liabilities < 1 from launch,
hidden by fresh money — and the manager dumps / the run hits. The rug.

**Three sharp properties:**

1. **The premium is a beauty contest.** Since enough believers sustain the premium, `q` is not
   "is the share worth this?" but **"will enough others keep believing — and is the premium backed
   by real NAV growth?"** A Keynesian coordination game *plus* a fundamentals check; memory of past
   cycles + the manager's track record inform both, raw single-shot talent cannot.
2. **NAV = memory: the oracle loop.** The fundamental is not exogenous — it is **what memory
   computes** (the holdings' competence, audited from the versioned store). So the asset's truth
   *is* the kernel's output. **The reversal (aigg-memory's killer property): re-deriving each
   holding's value is dear; *recalling* its track record is cheap** (the cost principle — expensive
   build-time, near-free runtime recall). So a capital-poor agent need not re-analyse the basket —
   only *remember* the holdings' and the manager's records. **Memory democratizes the NAV audit**:
   the cheap defence that lets the small investor see the premium/Ponzi the same as the whale.
3. **Front-running: centrality × memory.** Who hears the hype first buys the premium first and
   sells into the late buyers — diffusion structure decides who profits; **centrality concentrates
   the gain.** But centrality *without* the audit is amplified exposure: the well-connected who buy
   a Ponzi on hype hold the biggest bag. **centrality × memory wins; centrality alone is leverage
   on risk.**

**It instantiates the whole model:** diffusion (how the hype spreads), reflexivity (the
premium-to-NAV), the four channels (effort = the holdings' real production into NAV, luck = NAV
shocks, faculty = judging real NAV / a pumped premium, social capital = hearing first), and every
aigg-memory signature — **NAV oracle** (Σ track records), **provenance** of payouts (from NAV
growth vs new deposits), **reconcile** (claimed return vs realized NAV; price vs NAV), **reflection**
("this manager pumps → distrust"), **no-guess/`needs_review`** (an implausibly-high promised return
inconsistent with history → don't FOMO), **valid-time** (a stale premium must stop driving action).

**Decisive readouts.** rug-rate / fraud-haul by memory condition (E5/E8) — the headline; the
**premium-to-NAV Hype Cycle** amplitude ≈ (1 − memory) (E7); the **coverage ratio** exposing
insolvency and a Ponzi's reach ≈ (1 − memory) (E8); capital allocation by manager track record vs
share-price momentum (E4); and inequality (`Gini`) — does the premium concentrate wealth to the
early/connected, and does memory flatten it. E1 is the truthful slice (judge real NAV/competence);
E5/E8 are the manipulated slice (the pumped premium / the Ponzi) — same substrate.

## 9. Methodology

- **Counterfactual-clean ablation.** Reuse ELC's per-agent independent luck PRNGs: hold the
  luck seed fixed and toggle a treatment (memory on/off, social layer on/off, patron policy) →
  read the treatment's pure causal effect, exactly as ELC reads faculty's.
- **Four-way variance decomposition.** Regress / rank-correlate wealth against effort, luck,
  individual faculty, and social centrality; report each channel's share, plus `Gini`.
- **Metrics.** ELC's `ρ(wealth,·)` and `Gini`; the harness's `relationship_density` /
  centrality and `diffusion_traceable`; for the market instruments, Brier/log calibration and
  **rug-rate** (fraction of a manipulator's followers left at a loss) by memory condition.
- **Learning curve.** Track `q_t` (or trap-avoidance rate) over turns — the H-mem signature.

## 10. Architecture (interface integration, not a merge)

```
ELC economy + luck + metrics      → aigg-mud-demo (TS STF, counterfactual-clean PRNG)  [unchanged]
social substrate (the emergences) → aigg-memory/examples/eval (the rails + probes)
cognition (memory/reflect/plan)   → aigg-memory kernel, over HTTP
bridge                            → q's social/faculty terms <- facultyFromMemory + socialWarning;
                                    patron's track-record <- the versioned store
```

The two `experiments/` directories stay separate (different stacks, different subjects — see
the comparison in chat); they meet only at aigg-memory's public HTTP surface. `smallville.py`
already emits the `centrality` and `diffusion` structures that become the ELC social inputs at
scale.

## 11. Ethics & boundaries

- **Simulation only.** Every experiment runs on the STF / the eval harness with seeded PRNGs
  and play money. No real assets, exchanges, or funds.
- **No trading advice.** This program studies *dynamics*; it does not recommend any asset or
  position.
- **No manipulation tooling.** We do **not** build a system to rally real buyers or move a real
  price. Pump dynamics are modelled only to *study* them, and the defensible aigg-memory result
  is the **inverse** of a pump tool: memory as immunity (§7.2). The prosocial→antisocial duality
  (§7) is the reason the build target is the immune system, not the pathogen.

## 12. Experiment program (staged)

All experiments are slices of the §8 canonical scenario (the fund share, price vs NAV).

- **E1 — H-mem (shipped):** the *truthful-signal* slice — a recurring typed trap;
  `observe→reflect→recall` raises `q`; the discernment **learning curve** (`[0,0,1,1,…]` with
  memory, flat without). The ELC step's `q` reads from aigg-memory via the `agent` client.
- **E2 — H-social (shipped):** `socialWarning` diffuses over the relationship network;
  `ρ(wealth, centrality)` = +0.995 with the network, +0.28 without — independent of talent/luck.
- **E3 — H-coord, unified (shipped):** coordination is identical machinery; a venture vs a pump
  cabal is one knob (the value source), distinguishable only by counterparty-welfare sign —
  ρ(wealth,coord)=+1.0 both, but `track_record` starves the pumps (welfare −1 → +273; coordination
  pays only if it creates value). Resolves "isn't a coalition just a group pump?".
- **E4 — H-legibility (shipped):** the `track-record` patron policy allocates close to the
  `talent` oracle (realized-talent +0.703 vs +0.710) and beats `meritocratic` (+0.493, which
  rewards luck → higher Gini). Memory is a luck-filtered skill signal, so it makes skill bankable
  — capital by demonstrated competence, not by (lucky) wealth.
- **E5 — anti-manipulation immunity (shipped):** the *manipulated* slice of §8 — the
  memory-as-anti-manipulation **rug-rate** study (rugged 2/8 vs 8/8; discriminates the
  manipulator from an honest caller by provenance/track record). Next: a play-money
  prediction-market discernment scorer.
- **E6 — herd immunity (shipped):** the pump cabal vs memory penetration — manipulator profit
  collapses at the percolation threshold (535 marks → ~0 as memory crosses ~80% on ⟨k⟩=6); the
  self-fulfilling pump's reach ~ the susceptible cluster. Establishes `social_capital`'s
  earned-vs-extracted sign (with E2) and memory's herd-level immunity.
- **E8 — the Ponzi fund vs memory (shipped):** the asset is a fund share (price vs NAV); a Ponzi
  pays returns from new deposits (coverage < 1, insolvent from launch). Auditing the source of
  returns starves it — its reach falls ~ (1 − memory): haul 200→40, victims 1000→200. The
  controllable failure mode of the fund asset; E6 re-anchored onto coverage.
- **E7 — the Hype Cycle (shipped):** reflexive belief's waveform — diffusion→Peak,
  reconcile→Trough, reflect→Plateau (a clean curve, peak 1.99 / trough 0.40 / plateau 1.00) —
  with hype amplitude ≈ (1 − memory) (0.99 → 0.0): a society that all remembers has no bubble.
  Memory's third role: damping the cycle, beyond E6's immunity and discovery's enablement.
- **E-equity** runs across all: democratize vs concentrate (`Gini`), and whether legibility
  corrects it.

## 13. The one-line claim
